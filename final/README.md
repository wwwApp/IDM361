# 1 to 100

**A simple brain-training game to help you concentrate!**

This is the final project for IDM361: Interactive App Design I

The main goal of the game is to help you build your concentration as completing a simple task of reaching from 1 to 100.

## How to Play

It's simple, but challenging!

Your task is to click numbers in order until you reach 100. However, numbers will stay neither in order or in the same position, your task is also to find the appropriate next number in a randomized set of numbers.

Don't forget your chance to refresh numbers if you're stuck!
